# personal-site-react

My personal website, this time written in React! View it live at https://nickvaccaro.com.

This began as a port of [personal-site](https://github.com/NickJVaccaro/personal-site), which is written in Angular. It now has a backend and DB, however, so I can maintain a blog (and hopefully more easily update my now page regularly).

## The Stack

- Frontend: ReactJS + Redux + Bootstrap
- Backend: NodeJS + Express
- Database: MariaDB
